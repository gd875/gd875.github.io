Inventory is a web app that lets you manage inventory in a warehouse.
It allows you to create warehouses, products, and customers, and transfer inventory from your warehouses to your customers. It gives you up-to-date information about the inventory levels in your warehouse, and shows all transactions made by your customers.

The biggest challenge in the project was thinking about how my database should be structured, and the relationship between the tables. It required trial and error rolling back the migrations and changing the database structure as I build out the app, until it did what was required.
